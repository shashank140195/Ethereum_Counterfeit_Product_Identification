In this project, we  built a fake product identification system. That is, a system to detect the
fake products by using the blockchain technology. Because nowadays some brands have a fake copy of
them out there selling the same item at cheaper rates by compromising with the actual quality. Even
the experts of the original company may not be able to distinguish between fake products and their
real products. In this scenario, we can use blockchain technology to detect original products and add
a QR code to them while manufacturing by writing the QR code and product details to the blockchain
and letting the smart contract to judge. It is safe because the on chain data is not able to be eliminated
and every genuine product has only one valid QR code. People would be able to scan the QR code
using their smartphones and their smartphones will tell them whether the product is fake or not.
