In this project, we  built a fake product identification system. That is, a system to detect the
fake products by using the blockchain technology. Nowadays some brands have fake copies of
them out there selling the same item at cheaper rates by compromising with the actual quality. Even
the experts of the original company may not be able to distinguish between fake products and their
real products. In this scenario, we can use blockchain technology to detect original products and add
a QR code to them while manufacturing by writing the QR code and product details to the blockchain
and letting the smart contract to judge. It is safe because the on-chain data is not able to be eliminated
and every genuine product has only one valid QR code. People would be able to scan the QR code
using their smartphones and their smartphones will tell them whether the product is fake or not.

Our goals for this project are as follows:
1. The goal of the project is to create a secure and transparent system for tracking and verifying the authenticity of products using blockchain technology.

2. To make the system user-friendly and accessible, so that consumers can easily verify the authenticity of a product and businesses can participate in the system without needing to have a deep understanding of blockchain technology.\
   
3. To secure product details using a QR code, which will be scanned by consumers to verify the authenticity of a product.
   
4. To provide security to clients by offering data and transparency about the products they are purchasing.
  
5. To improve the ability to detect fake products in the marketplace, and to enhance the overall performance of the anti-counterfeit system.
   
By achieving these goals, we aim to create an effective and secure anti-counterfeit system that will protect consumers, support legitimate businesses, and help to disrupt the market for counterfeit goods.
